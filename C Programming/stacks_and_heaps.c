//OS allocates stacks and heaps to hold variables used during the execution of a program
//Stack is used to hold variables whose life is equal to life a particular function and not the entire program(auto variables)
//Heaps are used to hold variables whose life is equal to life of an entire program(static, global and dynamically allocated variables)
