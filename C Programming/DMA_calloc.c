//Calloc is also used for dynamic memory allocation. Difference between
//malloc and calloc is that malloc initializes the memory space with garbage values.
//Calloc on the other hand initializes all bytes with 0 value.
//malloc receives only one argument i.e. size of dynamic memory but calloc receives two arguments
// i.e number elements that we need to allocate and size of each element
